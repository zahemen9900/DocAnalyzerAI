We own most of our roasting facilities and lease the majority of our warehousing and distribution locations. As of September 29, 2024, Starbucks had 21,018 company-operated stores, almost all of which are leased. We also lease space in various locations worldwide for regional, district, and other administrative offices, training facilities, and storage. In addition to the locations listed above, we hold inventory at various locations managed by third-party warehouses. We believe our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.
